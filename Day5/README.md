# Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Tree & Random Forest

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient health data.  
The dataset used is **heart.csv** (Heart Disease dataset).  
The code trains models, evaluates performance, visualizes results, and saves outputs for easy download.

## ⚙️ Features
- Train & evaluate **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** classifiers.
- Compare accuracy, classification reports, and cross-validation scores.
- Visualize **Decision Tree structure** and **Feature Importances**.
- Save all results to a `.txt` file and plots to `.png` images.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset **heart.csv** contains health parameters such as:
- `age`, `sex`, `cp` (chest pain type)
- `trestbps` (resting blood pressure), `chol` (cholesterol level)
- `fbs` (fasting blood sugar), `restecg` (ECG results)
- `thalach` (max heart rate), `exang` (exercise-induced angina)
- `oldpeak` (ST depression), `slope`, `ca`, `thal`
- `target` (0 = No disease, 1 = Disease)
