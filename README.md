# Task 3: Linear Regression - AI & ML Internship

This project demonstrates simple and multiple linear regression using the Housing dataset. Implemented using **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

## 📁 Files
- `Task3_LinearRegression.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with all steps
- `Housing.csv`: Dataset (download manually from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction))

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Data Preprocessing
- Train-test split
- Model Training (LinearRegression)
- Evaluation: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²
- Regression Plot (for simple regression)

## 📌 Instructions
1. Download `Housing.csv` and place it in the same folder.
2. Open `Task3_LinearRegression.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells sequentially.
